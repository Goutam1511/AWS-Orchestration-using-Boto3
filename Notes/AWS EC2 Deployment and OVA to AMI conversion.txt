Steps to convert an OVA to AMI manually:

1) Install AWS CLI.
2) Create a S3 Bucket and upload the OVA into it.
3) Create an IAM role named vmimport with proper trust relationships using below command.
   Use the file "trust-policy.json" for this.
   
   aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

4) Put the permissions in the newly created role from file "role-policy.json" using below command.
   
   aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document "file://role-policy.json"

5) Convert OVA to AMI using below command.

   aws ec2 import-image --description "<comment>" --disk-containers "file://containers.json"

The containers.json file is of the format :
[
  {
    "Description": "<Description>",
    "Format": "ova",
    "UserBucket": {
        "S3Bucket": "<bucket-name>",
        "S3Key": "<Path to ova/OVA name>.ova"
    }
}]

Basic Steps to create an AWS EC2:

1) Create a VPC and give a CIDR block of suitable IP. (Dashboard->Services->VPC->Give suitable inputs)
2) Create a Subnet and attach it to the VPC. Give an appropriate range of IP from VPC CIDR block.
(Dashboard->Services->VPC->Subnets->Give inputs)
3) A default route table will be automatically created after the above two steps.
4) Create an Internet Gateway by giving a suitable name.(Dashboard->Services->VPC->Internet Gateways->Give inputs)
5) Create a seperate route table and add an entry to that table for the Gateway and attach that route table
   to the created subnet. 
6) Finally create a t2.large EC2 instance from the converted AMI's of OVA from "My AMI"-s.
7) While creating EC2 instance, a default security group will be created. Edit it later as per requirement.
8) While creating EC2 instance, make sure of these steps -
   a) Choose the VPC created
   b) Choose the subnet created
   c) Always mark the option "Assign Public IP automatically" and "enable DNS"
9) While creating EC2 instance, select the key pair generated previously or if not created, then create
   a new key pair. Convert it to Putty usable format using PuttyGen.
